# Sandflies Preview

This repository is for Sandfly hunting modules to help find emerging threats or for Beta testing. 

Sandfly customers are able to use the custom sandflies here to augment their threat detection immediately with agentless scanning and incident response.

Using modules in this directory is straightforward:

1) Go to the Sandflies menu item in the console.
2) Click the "Add+" button in the upper right.
3) Paste in the JSON from the module you wish to add and click Save.

Please see the documentation for more information on adding and editing custom sandflies:
